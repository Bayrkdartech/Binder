# Electricity Consumption Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing electricity consumption data to uncover usage patterns, forecast future demand, and improve energy efficiency. By examining time-series data collected from smart meters or utility records, the analysis aims to provide insights into how electricity is consumed over time across different regions and user types.

## Objectives
- Understand consumption trends and peak usage times
- Predict future electricity demand using statistical and machine learning models
- Identify opportunities to optimize energy usage and reduce costs
- Support sustainable energy management by integrating environmental factors

## Data
The dataset typically includes timestamped electricity usage values, often at hourly or daily intervals, along with relevant contextual information such as location and user category.

## Tools and Techniques
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Time series analysis and visualization
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Reporting insights for decision-making

This analysis can help utilities, researchers, and policymakers to better manage electrical resources and plan for future energy needs.
